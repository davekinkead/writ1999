# Arguments

## What are arguments?

So what then is an argument?  The Monty Python boys give us a good starting definition.

> A connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition.
> -- Monty Pyton

Arguments contain statements, specifically propositions.  Propositions are sharable objects of attitudes that bear truth content.  Propositions can be true or false.

We call these propositions _premises_ & _conclusions_.

>  An argument is a connected series of statements, sentences, or propositions (called “premises”) that are intended to give reasons for some kind of statement, sentence, or proposition (called the “conclusion”).  
> -- Sinnott-Armstrong and Fogelin

Arguments are designed to convince. Either yourself or someone else.  The _who_ is the audience. The _what_ is the conclusion.

Arguments can be used to _justify_ or _explain_.  Justificatory arguments advance a particular claim not already accepted. You can think of them as forward looking.  Explainatory arguments give reasons for believing a claim already accepted. They can be thought of as backward looking.

So an argument requires:

  - An audience: who is supposed to be persuaded by the argument?
  - Some premises: what are the reasons given for the conclusion?
  - A conclusion: what is the argument meant to establish?


## What makes for a good argument?

How might we judge a good argument?  What criteria should we use?

  - pursuasiveness?
  - conviction?
  - length?
  - beauty?

One important criteria is _truth preservation_.  Certain types of argument _preserve_ and _transmit_ the truth of the premises to the conclusion.

We call this feature _validity_.

> An argument is valid iff the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusions.

Or

> An argument is valid iff it is impossible for the conclusion to be false while all the premises are true.

Validity is concerned with hypothetical truth.  The premises don't need to be true for an argument to be valid.  Validity is concerned only with the notion that _if_ the premises were true, would that guarantee that the conclusion was true.

Examples:

  > All men are mortal
  > Justin Bieber is a man
  > Therefore Justin Bieber is mortal 

We might doubt the truth of premise 2 (or 1), but if they were true, it would be impossible for Justin to be immortal. (Let's hope the same is true for his music)

  > If it's raining then it's Monday
  > It's not Monday
  > Therefore it's not raining

  > It is Monday
  > It isn't Monday
  > Therefore the Statue of Liberty is made of cheese.

Validity obviously isn't enough.  What we also want is actual truth.  When the premises of a valid argument are true, we call the argument _sound_.  And given the definition of validity, this makes the conclusion true.


## Argument Structure

We can structure arguments in a number of ways.  We could do this graphically with an argument map.

    Argument Map

We are going to focus on _standard form_.

    1. Here is a reason
    2. And another reason
    3. Therefore the conclusion (from 1 & 2)

We are going to concentrate on Propositional Logic first before moving into Categorical Logical and Inductive Reasoning.  Propositional logic argument look like this:

    1. Either A or B
    2. Not B
    3. Therefore A (from 1 & 2)

Premises come first. Then the conclusion.  And in more complex arguments, we say which premises entail the conclusion.

The structure of propositional arguments means that in a valid argument, anything can be substituted for the _propositional variables_.

When we are focusing on validity, we are looking at argument form.
