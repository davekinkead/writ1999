# Deductive Writing Workshop

## Exercise 1 - Validity

Break into groups of 3-4. Then:

  1. Choose an philosoraptor question for your group
  2. Specify a proposition related to the question that you want to advance. This is your main conclusion.
  3. Create a valid argument that entails your main conclusion.
  4. For each premise, create another argument that entails each premise.


## Excerise 2 - Soundess

Choose a statement:

- Love is just a feeling.
- Emotions are irrational.
- It's better to be unhappy than ignorant.
- God is dead.
- God isn't dead, she's just hiding.
- Morality is relative.
- It's ok to eat an animal.
- Letting someone die is as bad as killing them.
- Sometimes it's ok to cheat.
- Animals have rights.
- Slavery is ok in a democracy if the majority supports it.

Then:

  1. Create a sound argument to entail the statement (or it's negation)
  2. Justify each premise in 50-100 words
