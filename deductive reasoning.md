# Deductive Logic 

In the last lecture, we covered two criteria that make for a good argument: _validity_ and _soundness_.  In this lecture, we will look at these notions in more detail.

Validity & soundness are the domain of _deductive logic_.

There are a few qualities that differentiate deductive from inductive logic including _monotonicity_, _indefeasability_ and _truth preservation_.  And it's the latter that we will be concerned with the most.

Truth preservation means that the truth of the premises can be transmitted to the conclusion.  If an argument is valid, then the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.

Let's look at our two definitions of validity again.

> An argument is valid iff the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusions.

And

> An argument is valid iff it is impossible for the conclusion to be false while all the premises are true.

And when the premises of a valid argument are true, then it is _sound_.

> An argument is sound iff it is valid and all of it's premises are true.

Truth preservation is an incredibly powerful tool of reason.  In some arguments, the premises _support_ the conclusion.  Sometimes a little, sometime a lot.

> Driving is dangerous. Sometimes people have car accidents.  Therefore you shouldn't drive unless absolutely necessary.

> There is a strong correlation between smoking and the incidence of a number of diseases including lung cancer.  Therefore you shouldn't smoke.

But in deductively valid arguments, the truth of the premises _guarantees_ the truth of the conclusion.

> If she weights the same as a duck, then she's made of wood.
> And if she's made of wood, the she'll burn.
> And if she burns, then she's a witch.
> Therefore if she weights the same as a duck, she's a witch!

_If_ the premises are true, then it is impossible for the conclusion to be false.  Think about how powerful this idea is. If you are certain about the premises, then you can be certain about the conclusion.


## Testing Validity

So how do we know when an argument is valid?  Later in the course we look at a variety of ways but for now, we are going to look at _counter examples_.

Take a look at the definition of validity again.

> An argument is valid iff it is impossible for the conclusion to be false while all the premises are true.

Given this definition, what would a counter example to validity look like?  Any counter example will be an example where the conclusion is false while the all premises are true.

If you can find a counter example, then the argument isn't valid!

What would a counter example to the following look like, and would it be possible?

> If it's raining, then the grass is wet.  
> It's not raining.  
> Therefore the grass isn't wet.  

> All philosophy courses will hurt your brain
> This is a philosophy course
> Therefore this course will hurt your brain

> Either you support mass surveillance or you support terrorism
> You don't support mass surveillance
> Therefore you support terrorism

So to recap, one way to show an argument is invalid is to find a counter example.  And to find a counter example, we must

  - recite the definition of validity
  - identify what a counter example would look like
  - see if that is possible, if the premises were true


## Testing Soundness

What about soundness then?  Again let's look at the definition. 

> An argument is sound iff it is valid and all of it's premises are true.

That gives us two ways to show that an argument is unsound:

  - show at least one of the premises is untrue
  - show that it's structure is invalid


## Parallel Arguments

An extension of the counterexample method of testing validity is to use _parallel arguments_.  Parallel arguments are an informal way of demonstrating that an argument is invalid.

As their name suggests, parallel arguments mimic the logical structure of the the arguments they are attempting to refute, but use different propositional variables in such a way that the premises are clearly true and the conclusion is clearly false.

Parallel arguments are easy to spot and use.  Just begin with

> That's just like saying ...

Let's look at an example.

> Recognising indigenous Australians in the constitution wouldn't end racism
> Therefore we shouldn't recognise indigenous Australians in the constitution

> That's just like saying ...

> Recognising indigenous Australians wont cure cancer.
> Therefore we shouldn't recognise indigenous Australians in the constitution

Here, the parallel argument shows that the premise doesn't entail the conclusion and therefore the argument is invalid.  Of course we could try and make the argument valid.

> The only reason to recognise indigenous Australians in the constitution is to end racism
> Recognising indigenous Australians in the constitution wouldn't end racism
> Therefore we shouldn't recognise indigenous Australians in the constitution

Now the argument is valid, but articulating the suppressed first premise shows that it is unsound.
