# Deductive Logic 

In the last lecture, we covered two criteria that make for a good argument: _validity_ and _soundness_.  In this lecture, we will look at these notions in more detail.

Validity & soundness are the domain of _deductive logic_.

There are a few qualities that differentiate deductive from inductive logic including _monotonicity_, _indefeasability_ and _truth preservation_.  And it's the latter that we will be concerned with the most.

Truth preservation means that the truth of the premises can be transmitted to the conclusion.  If an argument is valid, then the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.

Let's look at our two definitions of validity again.

> An argument is valid iff the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusions.

And

> An argument is valid iff it is impossible for the conclusion to be false while all the premises are true.

Truth preservation is an incredibly powerful tool of reason.  In some arguments, the premises _support_ the conclusion.  Sometimes a little, sometime a lot.

> Driving is dangerous. Sometimes people have car accidents.  There you shouldn't drive unless absolutely necessary.

> There is a strong correlation between smoking and the incidence of a number of diseases including lung cancer.  Therefore you shouldn't smoke.

But in deductively valid arguments, the truth of the premises _guarantees_ the truth of the conclusion.

> If she weights the same as a duck, then she's made of wood.
> And if she's made of wood, the she'll burn.
> And if she burns, then she's a witch.
> Therefore if she weights the same as a duck, she's a witch!
