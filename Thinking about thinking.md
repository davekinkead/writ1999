# Thinking about Thinking

## What is critical thinking?

What does it mean to think critically?  To answer this, we first need to get clear on thinking and this isn't easy.  Is it just brain activity? Cognition? Or reflection?

If it is just cognition, then animals and machines can think.

    Neural Net Dreams

And perhaps even plants.

Let's run with the more narrow idea that thinking is the formation of beliefs.

> In its loosest sense, thinking signifies everything that, as we say, is "in our heads " or that "goes through our minds." He who offers "a penny for your thoughts" does not expect to drive any great bargain ... Daydreaming, building of castles in the air, that loose flux of casual and disconnected material that floats through our minds in relaxed moments are, in this random sense, thinking.  
> -- John Dewey, How we Think. Chapter 1.

What is critical thinking then?

> Reflective thought is consecutive, not merely a sequence
> -- John Dewey, How we Think. Chapter 1.  

Critical thinking is something more.  Any conception of it will need to include deliberate and reflectic thought, working memory, and meta cognition - thinking about thinking.


## Thinking Fast & Slow

      Meet Jane.  She's 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy and finance. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.

      Which is more probable?

      Jane is an accountant.
      Jane is an accountant working for Greenpeace.

If you chose the second option, you've committed what's know as a fallacy of conjunction.  Option 2 seems more representative of Jane given the description but a moment's reflection on the maths make it clear that the first option must be more likely.

This is an example of a heuristic.  Heuristics are mental shortcuts - rules of thumb.

Heuristics are essential to our survivial.  When we see danger we need to react quickly, not contemplate the existential nature of our existance.

But they can also trip us up.
