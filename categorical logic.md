# Categorical Logic

## Propositional Review

  - deductive arguments are valid and sound
  - valid arguments are truth preserving
  - truth preservation is #awesome

  - we can test validity with counter examples
  - informally with parallel arguments
  - formally with truth tables

To find a CE, we

  - recite the definition of validity
  - identify what a CE would look like
  - see if that is possible, if the premises were true


Language you should be on top of

  - validity
  - soundness
  - proposition
  - premise
  - conclusion
  - counter example
  - assert
  - deny
  - antecedent
  - consequent
  
  -   
  - propositions aren't valid or invalid

Examples

  1.  Either it’s wrong to indiscriminately kill people, or it’s not wrong to kill someone just because she has red hair.
  2.  It’s wrong to kill someone just because she has red hair.
  3.  Therefore, it’s wrong to indiscriminately kill people.

  1. If it's Wednesday, then I must be in Belgium
  2. I's not Wednesday
  3. Therefore I'm not in Belgium

  1. Today is Tuesday
  2. Therefore either it's raining or it's not raining

Remember, validity is important but it's not enough.


## Universal Claims

Not all arguments can be described by negation, conjunction, disjunction, or implication.

  > All men are mortal
  > Justin Bieber is a man
  > Therefore Justin Bieber is mortal

All, every, none, and no are all _universal_ claims.

We can represent these propositions in venn diagrams

> All men are bastards

> No man is an island

## Particular Claims

But not all categorical propositions are so absolute.

  > Some rules are made to be broken

  > Some men can't jump
